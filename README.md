This account is a pointer to [my danzek account, go there](https://github.com/danzek) instead of here.

## Why?

Because I had [that account and username](https://github.com/danzek) before I started using the moniker "4n68r".

## But why would you make a second account?

Because people might look for me under this username. So now this is a pointer to [my main account](https://github.com/danzek).

## I still don't understand

    User* me = &danzek;

### Oh I get it now! But I don't appreciate your asterisk placement in that code example

Hear, oh disciple, [the words of Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#whitespace).
